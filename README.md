Hello my name is @Sonny0208-coder
I come from Vietnam, I am a high school student. I have a great passion for coding. My goal when logging into github is to learn more about it.
The languages ​​I am currently using and learning are Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS and possibly many other languages ​​like C++ (one of the difficult languages ​​for me to learn at the moment).
I hope to learn more to become a web developer.
Currently I have a small project to practice my programming skills. I want to build a website to sell Iphone. 
I know it's no longer strange to everyone now, but I hope everyone can help because I'm quite inexperienced.
